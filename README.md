# FoodMart
FoodMart is a Peer-to-Peer Food Commodity Marketplace that leverages Blockchain to offer efficient and Sustainable Food Distribution Systems to Consumers.

## How We Built it
We Built FoodMart with the Concept of Stacking and connecting Tech Stacks via API Standards. FoodMart is a three Layered Platform, which includes the P2P Marketplace built with React.js, the Backend & Cluster built with Node.js, and the Smart Contracts built with Vyper.

- Layer One is for User Interface/Experience
- Layer Two is for System Computations/Authentication
- Layer Three is for Funds management/Escrow
